## Indexical Timeline System

Experimental system based on a timeline with a semantic index to the items on the timeline. 

The timeline captures documents representing various kinds of information and activity, and the semantic index is created by linking the timeline items into a graph  that is constructed, consumed, and maintained based on custom predicates and categorical graph shapes
